    <h1>AI search depth</h1>
    <p>This game implements an opponent using MiniMax algorithm.</p> 
    <p> It looks specified amount of moves ahead and tries to pick the best possible move.</p>
    <p> Besides winning and losing configurations, AI hasn't been enhanced with any heuristics about 
    what kind of board configurations are good and bad.</p>
    <h2>Time</h2>
    <p>As game progresses, the number of moves that might lead to game ending situations increases so the algorithm becomes
    faster throughout the game.</p>
    <p> With the default 6 steps, it takes about 200-350 milliseconds to figure out the moves
    at the start of the game. 8 steps takes 6-8 seconds.</p>
